Titanic-Dataset-Survival-Prediction:

This dataset inlcudes columns like Age, Sex, Gender, Survival, PClass, Name etc.
My task was to predict whether the passengers will survive or not and what are the important factors. 
First I checked the shape of the data,datatypes in the dataset, checking null values. Then I have imputed all the null values using
median and categorical columns using mode. Treated outliers using capping method. EDA analysis was performed- Univariate analysis, 
Bivariate Analysis and Multivariate analysis.Dropping the unnecessary columns such as cabin, AgeGroupetc. Model Building was done 
by using various models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K nearest neighbour, Decision tree..Hyperparameter tuning was 
performed using Randomized Search CV.Out of which Random forest classifier gave the best performance(86%).
